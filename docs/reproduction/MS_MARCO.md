# Capreolus: monoBERT Ranking Baselines on MS MARCO Passage Retrieval 

This page contains instructions for running MaxP baselines on MS MARCO passage ranking task using Capreolus.
If you are a Compute Canada user, 
first follow [this](../setup/setup-cc.md) guide to set up the environment on CC then continue with this page.

Once the environment is set, you can verify the installation with [these instructions](./PARADE.md#testing-installation).


## Running MS MARCO 
This requires GPU(s) with 48GB memory (e.g. 3 V100 or a RTX 8000) or a TPU. 
1. Make sure you are in the top-level `capreolus` directory; 
2. Train on MS MARCO Passage using the following scripts, 
    while replacing the lr scheduler variables with the one you picked up <br/> 
    ```
    lr=1e-3
    bertlr=2e-5   
    niters=10
    warmupiters=1
    decayiters=$itersize  # either same with $itersize or 0
    decaytype=linear
    
    python -m capreolus.run rerank.train with \
        file=docs/reproduction/config_msmarco.txt  \
        reranker.trainer.lr=$lr \
        reranker.trainer.bertlr=$bertlr \
        reranker.trainer.niters=$niters \
        reranker.trainer.warmupiters=$warmupiters \
        reranker.trainer.decayiters=$decayiters \
        reranker.trainer.decaytype="linear" \
        fold=s1
    ```
3.  Without data preparation, it will take 4~6 hours to train and 8ï½ž10 hours to inference on *4 V100s* for BERT-base, 
    and longer on for BERT-large. 
    Per-fold metrics on dev set are displayed after completion, where `MRR@10` is the one to use for this task.
    (for CC users, BERT-large can only be run with batch size 16 on `graham` `cedar`, 
    as each node on `beluga` has 16GB memory at maximum)
